# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  unhandled exceptions during asynchronous operations.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that makes a network request but doesn't completely handle potential errors, which can lead to unexpected crashes. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code.

## Bug Description
The primary issue lies in the lack of comprehensive error handling within the `fetchData` function. Network requests can fail due to various reasons (network issues, server errors, etc.). The original code only prints an error message and then rethrows the exception without proper handling. This could lead to the application crashing or behaving unexpectedly.  A robust solution includes more sophisticated error handling, perhaps by presenting an error message to the user or retrying the operation.

## Solution
The improved version includes better exception handling, demonstrating the best practices when dealing with asynchronous operations and potential network failures in Dart.  This enhanced error handling makes the application more reliable and user-friendly.
